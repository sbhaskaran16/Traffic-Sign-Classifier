It is better to work with data sets that are centered about the zero mean and with small variance so that the learning process is quicker for the classifier and also a small variance is necessary to start with a classifier that isnt all sure about the incoming images, but gradually learns and improves its accuracy. \n",

Using the train_test_split function, setting the percentage size for the validation set at 20%, I divided the New data set (With additional samples - fake data generation - see above) into the training set and the validation set. Of course the test set was not part of the training set. The test set is kept separate and will be dealt with only when we are happy with the CovNet architecture. This ensures the validity of our classifier. \n",

I choose rotation, as it was pretty straightforward to use and implement into the code. Other approaches include and are not limited to increasing/decreasing contrast, brightness, resampling the image etc. I would like to test these appraoches too in the future and see how my classifier performs. \n",

I began with the very familiar CovNet architecture,introduced to us in class. I made it a point to stick to this architecture and then work around it to make sufficient variations. I began with simple chages in the data set, I resampled the image to a 64x64 image and then ran my training algorithm on it. I also had trial runs with different permutations between, the image size, whether it was gray scale or RGB. I concluded that with normalization and using gray-scale images provided me with consistently increasing validation accuracy values. \n",

I was convinced that, it doesn't really matter if its a very deep network. It has to be robust and do the job for us. I was happy with a validation accuracy of 98% on the validation set.
